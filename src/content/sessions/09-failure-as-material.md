title: Failure as material
description:
  Choosing a place for the instrument to fail on purpose, and defending that
  choice against "isn't that just a bug"
week: 9
date: 2027-04-19
teachers:
  - idris-fenn
spec:
  - you can point to one specific place where your instrument fails, breaks a rule, or degrades on purpose
  - you can say what that failure is doing for the piece, and how it differs from an actual bug you've also found this semester
related:
  - lectures/week-09

## Before the studio

Bring a list of two things: one place your instrument currently breaks by
accident, and (if you don't have one yet) an idea for a place it could break
on purpose instead.

## In the studio

Every instrument built so far has been debugged toward reliability. Today,
choose exactly one failure and keep it: a stroke that occasionally refuses to
obey the constraint, a decay that overshoots, a seed that produces one
malformed result in a hundred. The hard part isn't writing the failure, it's
the two-sentence defence: what is a viewer meant to feel when it happens, and
why is that better than the instrument simply working. If you can't answer
that, it's still a bug --- fix it instead.

## Afterwards

Show the chosen failure to someone without telling them it's deliberate first.
If they report it to you as a bug, your defence from the studio needs another
pass before the exhibition.

## Stretch goal

Write the two-sentence defence down as a comment in the code, right next to
where the failure happens, rather than keeping it in your head. By week 12
you will have forgotten your own reasoning at least once already this
semester; don't let this be the failure that costs you.
