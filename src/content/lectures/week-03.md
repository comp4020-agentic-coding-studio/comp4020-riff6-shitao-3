`PointerEvent.pressure` looks like the obvious way to make a mark
expressive --- it's a number, right there on the event. It's also unreliable:
a mouse reports a constant 0.5, most touchscreens report 0 without a stylus
that supports force, and a keyboard has no pressure at all. Reach for it and
you've deepened one input path and quietly broken the course's own standing
rule that every instrument answers to more than one hand.

The signal that survives across mouse, touch and keyboard alike is timing:
how long since the last event, how far the position moved in that interval.
Compute it yourself from the event stream you already have, and every input
device feeds it identically. The same reasoning goes one step further later in
the semester --- some expressive qualities aren't tied to a single event at
all, but to shared state a map or a counter already tracks, which is free
across every input path for the same reason.

## Outline

- why `pressure` is the wrong first reach, device by device
- computing velocity and dwell time from your own event stream instead
- state-based signals as a further step past timing signals, for later weeks

## Look at

Ben Shneiderman's direct-manipulation principles --- continuous
representation, physical actions instead of typed syntax, immediately
visible results --- were written for pointing devices decades before touch
and stylus existed, and they hold up precisely because they're about timing
and feedback, not about any one piece of hardware. Golan Levin's writing on
software for artists is a useful second stop, if you want to see the same
argument made from the artist's side of the keyboard rather than the
platform designer's.
